## Project: Go-based Trading Bot

This project is a Go (Golang) application designed to interact with the Binance Spot API for automated trading. It leverages the following key libraries and concepts:

1. **Go**: Main programming language used.  
2. **Binance API**: Spot trading endpoints for placing orders, checking balances, and retrieving price information.  
3. **godotenv**: Used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.  
4. **HMAC-SHA256**: Required for signing requests to Binance.  

> **Note**: This README and the associated code were generated with the assistance of AI.

## How It Works

1. **Environment Variables**  
   - The bot reads `BINANCE_API_KEY` and `BINANCE_API_SECRET` from a `.env` file.  
   - If either key is missing or empty, the bot exits with an error.

2. **Initialization**  
   - The `init()` function loads the `.env` file and checks if the required environment variables exist.  
   - If `.env` is missing or the variables are not defined, the bot logs a fatal error and terminates.

3. **Ping Check**  
   - At startup, the bot sends a `ping` request to Binance (`/api/v3/ping`).  
   - If the ping fails, the bot immediately exits. Otherwise, it proceeds to start.

4. **Trading Strategy**  
   - Retrieves 24h volume data for symbols, checks balances, and gathers kline data.  
   - Uses simple RSI & MACD indicators to determine buy/sell conditions, plus stop-loss and take-profit.

5. **Logging**  
   - Various log messages indicate buy/sell events, stop-loss triggers, take-profit triggers, etc.

## File Structure

- `main.go` # Contains the main trading bot logic 
- `.env` # Environment variables (not committed to version control)
- `go.mod` # (Optional) Go module file for dependencies

## Setup & Installation

1. **Install Go**  
   - Download and install from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).

2. **Create a .env File**  
   - In the project root, create `.env`:
     ```
     BINANCE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
     BINANCE_API_SECRET=YOUR_API_SECRET
     ```
   - Replace with actual values.

3. **Build & Run**  
go build -o binance_bot main.go ./binance_bot
Or directly:
go run main.go

## Usage & Configuration

- **Portfolio**  
In `main.go`, edit:
portfolio := map[string]float64{ "BTCUSDT": 80, "ETHUSDT": 40, }
Adjust as needed.

- **Intervals & Thresholds**  
autoTradePortfolio( portfolio, buyInterval, // e.g. 3600 seconds stopLossPct, // e.g. 0.05 = 5% takeProfitPct, // e.g. 0.1 = 10% rsiPeriod, buyRSIThreshold, sellRSIThreshold, ... )
